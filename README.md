## Reflection
This was 8-day mini project during my Digital Skill Fair 29.0 bootcamp by [dibimbing.id](https://dibimbing.id), which was held from July 15 until July 22, 2024. The goals of doing this project are to improve my front-end development skills and practice about how to make clean and user-friendly layouts.

One of the main challenges during this web project was Product Cards Layouting. It was not so easy to manage many cards in one single HTML file. Therefore, I started to learn about DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) concept in Django and ReactJS.

At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are HTML and CSS. I plan to learn more about ReactJS and implement the framework in the next iteration.
